# Activity 5 - GitHub Pages Project Webpage

In this activity you'll practice creating github pages. You'll build a website about your favorite type of music!

### Instructions

Make a simple website about your favorite type of music.

- Create a header that will act as a title for the page
- Create a few short paragraphs describing the best characteristics of the music you selected .
- list 3 song option with wither a link to play song or an embedded player to play them
- Include at least one picture of album or song

- Once you have created your HTML add, commit, and push your files up to GitHub then publish them with github Pages.
  - Make sure to navigate to your page in the web browser to ensure your website is live before submitting.

### Guide

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account. _You can name this repository whatever you would like._
2. Clone repo down. and open it in visual studio code. Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it `index.html` ad css styles
3. Add your HTML and CSS, save them then do your: add, commit and push. back on github navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source
5. save changes and when it reloads scroll to the pages section and now you should see a link to your website LIVE!
6. FYI: your page always publiches fllowing this logic `YOUR USERNAME.github.io/REPO NAME YOU CHOSE` and you will find that your new web page will always be there live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and the project is `cssDemo`, your URL would be `johndoe.github.io/cssDemo`)
